      <p>
        Whether studying theology at Yale, data science at UC Berkeley, or the
        liberal arts at Princeton, I love thinking in new ways to find creative
        solutions to tough challenges. Before coming to Yale, I worked for four
        years as an operations engineer and general manager for an industrial
        supply distributor in Atlanta. I solved a wide-array of problems from
        <em>“How do you get thousands of packages through a half-built warehouse
        without a working conveyor?”</em> to <em>“How do you lead a department to
        complete 100% of its work every day when it's only been getting through
        70% of its work on a good day?”</em> More recently, I’ve worked as a
        product manager in a tech start-up, building the right relationships with
        business partners and software engineers to ensure our start-up built
        effective and genuinely useful software. I am excited to bring my diverse
        skillset to a team of passionate folks, who refuse to stay in their lane,
        as we work together to positively impact our communities.
