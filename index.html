        Alex graduated from Princeton in 2013 with a bachelor's in Near Eastern Studies.
        He took a job in a completely related field, operations, at an industrial supply
        company called McMaster-Carr. At this company, Alex fell in love with finding creative
        solutions to everyday problems. <em>How do you get thousands of packages through
        a half-built warehouse without a working conveyor or any packing stations? How do
        you lead a department to complete 100% of its work every day when it's only been
        getting through 70% of its work on a good day?</em> While putting his brain to
        work with these engaging questions, Alex decided to pursue a Master of Data Science
        from UC Berkeley. It might be helpful to think of data science as
        the intersection of statistics and programming. Now, Alex is off to pursue different
        questions at Yale Divinity School. As he discerns his path forward, Alex
        knows any next steps must stimulate his intellectual curiousity and engage his critical thinking
        and problem-solving skills.
