  Alex graduated from Princeton in 2013 with a bachelor's in Near Eastern Studies.
  He took a job in a completely related field, operations, at an industrial supply
  company called McMaster-Carr. At this company, Alex fell in love with finding creative
  solutions to everyday problems. <em>How do you get thousands of packages through
  a half-built warehouse without a working conveyor or any packing stations? How do
  you lead a department to complete 100% of its work every day when it's only been
  getting through 70% of its work on a good day?</em> While putting his brain to
  work with these engaging questions, Alex decided to pursue a Master of Information
  and Data Science from UC Berkeley. It might be helpful to think of data science as
  the intersection of statistics and programming. Now, Alex is off to pursue even
  harder questions at Yale Divinity School. He's especially concerned with questions
  about the repentance of God and the problem of injustice. If you've solved either
  of these problems, please drop him a line!
