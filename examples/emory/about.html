    What is Emory Math Circle?

  </div>

  <div class="body">
    Emory Math Circle is a free math enrichment program for middle school and
    high school students in the Atlanta area. Our goal is to teach students how
    to think both logically and creatively while sparking and developing in them
    a passion for mathematics. We want to expose students to topics outside of
    the standard mathematics curriculum and let them experience the mathematical
    process of asking questions, making conjectures, and working to prove them.
    Our sessions are interactive, fun, and challenging.
