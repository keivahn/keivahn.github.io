    <a href="http://jrmf.org/" target="_blank">Julia Robinson Math Festival</a>
  </div>

  <div class="body">
    Julia Robinson Mathematics Festivals inspire students to explore the
    richness and beauty of mathematics through activities that encourage
    collaborative, creative problem-solving.  The festival provides an
    alternative to the competitive culture of math contests, with tables
    dedicated to different problems and activities, each with a
    mathematician standing by to offer guidance and encouragement without
    giving away too much. Says the Festival's Mathematics Director,
    Joshua Zucker, "We offer intriguing and challenging problems, puzzles, and
    activities, and a supportive setting for kids who like to take their time
    working on a problem. Students make whatever progress they make, they get
    help, they work with other kids, and eventually come to some kind of
    stopping point and go find another activity of interest."

  <div class="body">
    Emory held our second festival on Saturday September 10, 2016 from 1 - 4 pm.
    It was aimed at students in grades 6 - 12, although some advanced 4th and 5th graders
    also participated.

    <a href="https://fs7.formsite.com/strebat/WME/index.html" target="_blank">Week of Mathematical Exploration</a>
  </div>

  <div class="body">
    Experience the process of doing mathematics by diving deeply into an
    exploratory problem. Participants will work in groups of 2 or 3 and pick one
    problem to focus on for the week. Like professional mathematicians, they
    will do examples, ask questions, look for patterns, make conjectures, and
    come up with their own proofs. They will be assigned a graduate student mentor
    who they will meet with twice a day. We will end each day with a lecture
    given by a mathematics faculty member. On the last day, we will have lunch
    with some undergraduate students who are at Emory for the summer to do
    mathematics research, and they will give short "teaser talks" introducing
    their research areas. Afterwards, participants will give presentations on
    their findings.
  </div>

  <div class="body">
   The summer 2017 program will be held Monday June 5th through Friday June 9th.  Students who are currently in levels C and D of Emory Math Circle may apply <a href="https://fs7.formsite.com/strebat/WME/index.html">here</a>.  Please apply by February 28th to receive full consideration. More information about the program, including a preliminary schedule, is available on the application form.

  </div>

  <div class="body">
    The Atlanta Science Festival is an annual celebration of local science and
    technology. For one week in march, curious people of all ages will explore
    the science and technology in our region and see how science is connected
    to all parts of our lives in a variety of hands-on activities, facility
    tours, presentations, and performances throughout the metro Atlanta region.
    The Festival culminates in the free, family-friendly
    <a href="http://atlantasciencefestival.org/expo">Exploration Expo</a> - an
    interactive day of demos, hands-on activities, and stage shows at Centennial Olympic Park.
  </div>

  <div class="body">
    Emory Math Circle had a booth at the Exploration Expo in 2014 and 2016.
    We hope to do so every year!
